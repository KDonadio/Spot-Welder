# Spot-Welder
This project was inspired by something I found on the web that I wanted to expand upon.

The original site was http://www.kerrywong.com/2017/06/18/dual-purpose-spot-welder-with-pulse-duration-control/

Like most hobbyists or design engineers, I have a curious nature and usually have a dozen projects all going at once, this seemed like yet another neat project to add to the list.

Having recently updated our kitchen appliances I just happened to have an old microwave oven that was destined for the landfill. So the donor for the transformer was sitting in my garage.
I tore the oven apart to find a huge power transfomer which is used to power the magnetron (device used to create the RF waves that cook the food in the microwave).

With this transformer scavanged I had the heart of my new spot welder! I like Kerry's project but being an electrical engineer myself and loving microcontrollers the way I do I thought upgrading the controller was in order.
I quickly sketched up a schematic in Altium ui=sing a PIC18F26K40, 2x16 LCD, rotary encoder, isolated power supply and a SSR(Solid State Relay).
